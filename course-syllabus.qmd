## Course Objectives

This course introduces students to the foundational concepts and practical
skills in electronic circuits designed for detecting biological signals.

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

* Perform circuit analysis using:
  * Ohm's Law
  * Kirchhoff's Voltage and Current Laws (KVL & KCL)
  * Equivalent Resistance for Series and Parallel Circuits
  * Node Voltage Analysis
  * Mesh Current Analysis
* Analysis circuits using the complex impedance of reactive capacitors and inductors.
  * Use phasors to describe amplitude and phase for reactive circuit analysis.
  * Generate and interpret Bode plots
* Analysis and design first- and second-order filters in the frequency and time domains.
* Circuit schematic capture (KiCad)
* Circuit SPICE simulation (KiCad)
* Develop skills to use common electronic bench equipment to drive and measurement electronic circuits, including:
  * Use DC and AC voltage sources.
  * Use oscilloscopes to evaluate time and frequency domain circuit response.
  * Use digitial multimeters to measure voltage, current and impedance.
  * Use function generators to generate time-varying signals to input into circuits.
* Understand ideal operational amplifiers and their use in active amplifiers and filters.
* Understand basic semiconductor physics to describe how diodes work, and use diodes for clamping and rectification.
* Work with basic digital input/output signals using an Arduino-based microcontroller.

## Prerequisites

## Learning Management System

We will be using [Canvas](https://canvas.duke.edu) as the learning management
system for this course.  Most resources will be linked to the course website.
All grades will be posted via Canvas/Gradescope.

Ed Discussion will be used for general course questions and discussion.

## Class Schedule

This class is organized in a sequence of learning modules.  Specific details
surrounding dates for assignments associated with each module will be posted to
Gradescope and linked below.  

### Learning Module Schedule

{{< include _schedule.qmd >}}

### Special Dates

* Labor Day - No Class (Sep 01, 2025)
* Fall Break - No Class (Oct 11-14, 2025)
* Midterm I (Mon, Sep 22, 2025)
* Midterm II (Wed, Oct 08, 2025)
* Midterm III (Wed, Dec 03, 2025)
* Final Lab Practical (Dec 10, 2025, 09:00-12:00)

::: callout-important
Unless there are unforeseen circumstances that affect our course schedule, midterm and final lab practical dates should not change.
:::

## Attendance & Participation

Class participation in lecture is strongly encouraged.  Students are responsible
for obtaining missed lecture content from other students in the class.  All
lecture slides/presented content will be made availabe online (Canvas),
and lectures will be recorded via Panopto and posted to Canvas.

Participation on Ed Discussion is also encouraged, in the form of:

* Asking questions about the course material (ideally, publicly, so that others can benefit (Anonymous okay))
* Answering questions from other students
* Sharing interesting articles or resources related to the course material

## Assignments & Grading

### Grading

Fundamental knowledge will be assessed with regular online quizzes (~15%).

Lab exercises, as described above, are mandatory to pass the class.  Lab
exercises will synthesize your theoretical and analytic circuit analysis skills
with practical circuit debugging and testing.  Lab exercises will include
pre-lab efforts (15%) and post-lab Jupyter notebook submissions of data
collection and analysis from the lab exercises (15%).

A final lab practical, held during the final exam period in the lab, will be
worth 25%.

There will be three midterm exams, each worth 10%.

| Grade Category   | Relative Percentage   |
|:----------------|:---------------------|
| Quizzes         | 15%                  |
| Pre-Labs        | 15%                  |
| Post-Labs       | 15%                  |
| Midterms        | 3 Ã— 10% = 30%        |
| Lab Practical   | 25%                  |

: Grade Distribution

All assignment grades will be posted to Gradescope (and linked to the Canvas
gradebook) throughout the semester to track your performance.

### Course Grade

This course is not "curved" (i.e., a distribution of grades will not be
enforced), and a traditional grading scheme will be used (e.g., 90-93 = A-,
94-97 = A, 97-100 = A+).  Participation throughout the semester will influence
rounding up/down for fractional grades.

::: callout-warning
Failing the course can happen with a cummulative score $<$ 65 (D) or more than
one unexcused lab absence.
:::

### Regrades

Any regrading requests need to be made **within one week of grades for a given
assignment being released**. You must make the request via Gradescope and
provide a description of why you feel a regrade is appropriate. Requesting a
regrade could lead to additional loss of credit when an assignment is
re-evaluated.

Some assignments will have an opportunity to be resubmitted based on grading
feedback at the discretion of Dr. Palmeri.

### Late Policy / SDAO Accomodations

Late submission windows will be available for all assignments, minus the
in-person lab sessions and the final lab practical, and should be used to
accomodate acute illness, travel, high workload from other classes and other
unforeseen circumstances.  *This late submission window can be utilized without
penalty and without prior approval.*

Students with SDAO accomodations for extended time on assignments can use this
extended late submission window for all assignments.

Any assignments submitted after the late submission window will only be accepted
for partial credit at the discretion of Dr. Palmeri or if prior approval was
sought **before the original (not extended) due date**.

## Duke Community Standard

All students are expected to adhere to all principles of the 
[Duke Community Standard](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/community-standard-student-conduct).
Violations of the Duke Community Standard will be referred immediately to the
Office of Student Conduct. Please do not hesitate to talk with Dr. Palmeri about
any situations involving academic honor, especially if it is ambiguous what
should be done.

## FAQ

### Can I collaborate with other students?

Engineering is inherently a collaborative field, and in this class, you are
encouraged to work collaboratively on your projects.  That being said, all of
the work that you submit must be generated by you and reflect your understanding
of the material. 

::: callout-important
All resources used in your assignment submissions that were developed by another
person or company must be properly acknowledged.
:::

### Can I use AI?

The use of artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing resource / tool in
engineering.  In software development, there are many levels of AI-assitance
available.  Such form of assistance include the
[IntelliCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/) tools
and [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (free to students
through the [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education/students) program).
These tools can be leveraged to help with syntax.  

::: callout-caution
You are strongly cautioned to not rely on these tools for solving circuit
analysis problems, as these tools will not be available for your midterm exams
and final lab practical.  They are best used to help complete code syntax in
this class.
