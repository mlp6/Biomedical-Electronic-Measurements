## Learning Objectives

- Define and describe the behavior of capacitors and inductors in DC and AC
circuits.

- Analyze circuits with capacitors and inductors in series and parallel.

- Understand the concept of reactance and impedance.

## Relevant Reading

Practical Electronics for Inventors, 4th Edition by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk:

- Chapter 2.23 (Cap Theory)

- Chapter 2.24 (Inductor Theory)

- Chapter 3.6 (Caps in Circuits)

- Chapter 3.7 (Inductors in Circuits)

## Reactive Components

- To date, we have only considered resistors, which dissipate energy as heat, to
consume source power.

- Resistive components respond "instantaneously" to changes in voltage and
current, as defined by Ohm's Law.

- Reactive components, such as capacitors and inductors, **store** energy in
electric and magnetic fields, respectively.

- This storage of energy takes time, so reactive components do not respond
instantaneously to changes in voltage and current.  This means that circuits
with reactive components have **transient** and **steady-state** responses to
time-varying sources.

## Ideal Capacitors

- A capacitor is a device that stores energy in an electric field.

- Composed of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material
(dielectric) that contains dipoles that become polarized in the presence of an
electric field.

- Permititivity, ε, is a measure of how easily a material can become polarized.
($\epsilon_{air} = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$)

- Charge, Q, is stored on the plates of a capacitor:

  - Take a finite amount of time to charge/discharge.

  - Finite capacity to store charge.

- Capacitance, C, is the ratio of charge to voltage:
  
  $$
  C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} \quad \text{(Farads, F)}
  $$

## Capacitor Voltage-Current Relationship

$$
Q = CV \quad \Rightarrow \quad I = \frac{dQ}{dt} = C\frac{dV}{dt}
$$

- Capacitors have a "memory" since $i_c(t)$ depends on the rate of change of
the voltage across the capacitor (i.e., how much charge has accumulated for
storage over time).

- Capacitors are linear elements since differentiation is a linear operation.

- Capacitors block DC current in steady-state since $dV/dt = 0$ for constant voltage.

For a steady-state DC voltage, a capacitor acts like an open circuit.

::: callout-tip
For a time-varying voltage, an uncharged capacitor acts like a short circuit at the instant
the voltage changes.

## Capacitor Voltage-Current Temporal Relationship

$$
\int i_c(t) dt = C \int \frac{dV_c(t)}{dt} dt \quad \Rightarrow \quad V_c(t) = V_c(t_0) + \frac{1}{C} \int_{t_0}^{t} i_c(\tau) d\tau
$$

- The voltage across a capacitor at time $t$ depends on:

  - The initial voltage $V_c(t_0)$, and
  
  - The integral of the current over time.

  - $t_0$ is the time when the capacitor was last charged or discharged and this new change in current is being evaluated.

## Capacitor Internals

## Power in a Capacitor

$$
P_c(t) = V_c(t) i_c(t) = V_c(t) C \frac{dV_c(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} C \frac{d}{dt} (V_c(t))^2
$$

- Power can be positive or negative, depending on the sign of $dV_c(t)/dt$.

- Positive power means energy is being stored in the capacitor (i.e.,
charging).

- Negative power means energy is being released from the capacitor (i.e.,
discharging).

## Energy in a Capacitor

$$
E_c(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t} P_c(\tau) d\tau = \frac{1}{2} C \int_{t_0}^{t} \frac{d}{dt} V_c^2(t) dt =  \frac{1}{2} C (V_c(t))^2 - \frac{1}{2} C (V_c(t_0))^2
$$

## Parallel Capacitors

<!-- TODO: add circuit diagram -->

- Let's draw a circuit with multiple capacitors in parallel.

- Capacitors in parallel have the same voltage across them.

- "Looks" like a single capacitor with larger capacitance (area):

$$
\begin{gather}
v_{C_1}(t) = v_{C_2}(t) = v_{C_3}(t) = \ldots = v_{C_n}(t) \\
i_n(t) = C_n \frac{dv_{C_n}(t)}{dt} \\
i(t) = \sum_{n} i_n(t) = \sum_{n} C_n \frac{dv_{C_n}(t)}{dt} = \left( \sum_{n} C_n \right) \frac{dv(t)}{dt}
\end{gather}
$$

$$
C_{eq} = \sum_{i} C_i
$$

- Capacitors in parallel have a similar relationship to resistors in series.

## Series Capacitors

<!-- TODO: add circuit diagram -->
- Let's draw a circuit with multiple capacitors in series.

- Capacitors in series have the same current through them.

- "Looks" like a single capacitor with smaller capacitance (distance):

$$
\begin{gather}
i_{C_1}(t) = i_{C_2}(t) = i_{C_3}(t) = \ldots = i_{C_n}(t) \\
v_n(t) = \frac{1}{C_n} \int i_{C_n}(\tau) d\tau \\
v(t) = \sum_{n} v_n(t) = \sum_{n} \frac{1}{C_n} \int i(\tau) d\tau = \left( \sum_{n} \frac{1}{C_n} \right) \int i(\tau) d\tau
\end{gather}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{C_i}
$$

- Capacitors in series have a similar relationship to resistors in parallel.

## Ideal Inductors

- An inductor is a device that stores energy in a magnetic field.

- Wound coil of wire around a core (air or ferromagnetic material).

- Time-varying current through the coil generates a magnetic field that
induces a voltage (electromotive force, emf) that opposes changes in current
(according to Lenz's Law).

- Magnetic Flux, Φ, is the measure of the strength of the magnetic field

$$
\Phi(t) = k N i_L(t) \quad \text{(Tesla)}
$$

- Inductance, L, is the ratio of magnetic flux to current:

  $$
  L = \frac{N \Phi}{i_L} = \frac{k N^2 A}{l} \quad \text{(Henrys, H)}
  $$
  
  where $k$ is a constant (permeability) that depends on the core material and
  geometry.

## Faraday's Law of Induction

::: {.callout-note title="Faraday's Law of Induction"}
A time-varying magnetic flux through a coil induces an electromotive force (emf)
(voltage) in the coil proportional to the rate of change of the flux.
:::

$$
v_L(t) = \frac{d\Phi(t)}{dt} = L \frac{di_L(t)}{dt}
$$  

::: callout-note
Note that the voltage across an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of current through it, while the voltage across a capacitor is proportional to the rate of change of voltage across it.
:::

## Inductor Voltage-Current Relationship

- Inductors have a "memory" since $v_L(t)$ depends on the rate of change of the
current through the inductor (i.e., how much magnetic flux has accumulated for
storage over time).

- Inductors are linear elements since differentiation is a linear operation.

- Inductors act like short circuits in steady-state DC since $di_L/dt = 0$ for
constant current.

- Inductors oppose changes in current, and transiently act like open circuits at
the instant the current changes.

## Inductor Voltage-Current Temporal Relationship

$$
\int v_L(t) dt = L \int \frac{di_L(t)}{dt} dt \quad \Rightarrow \quad i_L(t) = i_L(t_0) + \frac{1}{L} \int_{t_0}^{t} v_L(\tau) d\tau
$$  

## Power in an Inductor

$$
P_L(t) = V_L(t) i_L(t) = L \frac{di_L(t)}{dt} i_L(t) = \frac{1}{2} L \frac{d}{dt} (i_L(t))^2
$$

::: callout-tip
Power can be positive or negative, depending on the sign of $di_L(t)/dt$.
:::

## Energy in an Inductor

$$
E_L(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t} P_L(\tau) d\tau = \frac{1}{2} L (i_L(t))^2 - \frac{1}{2} L (i_L(t_0))^2
$$

::: callout-tip
The energy stored in an inductor is always positive.

## Parallel Inductors

- Let's draw a circuit with multiple inductors in parallel.

- Inductors in parallel have the same voltage across them.

- "Looks" like a single inductor with smaller inductance (area):

$$
\begin{gather}
v_{L_1}(t) = v_{L_2}(t) = v_{L_3}(t) = \ldots = v_{L_n}(t) \\
i_n(t) = \frac{1}{L_n} \int v_{L_n}(\tau) d\tau \\
\textrm{Using KCL...} \\
i(t) = \sum_{n} i_n(t) = \sum_{n} \frac{1}{L_n} \int v(\tau) d\tau = \left( \sum_{n} \frac{1}{L_n} \right) \int v(t) dt
\end{gather}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{L_{eq}} = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{L_i}
$$  

- Inductors in parallel have a similar relationship to resistors in parallel.

## Series Inductors

- Let's draw a circuit with multiple inductors in series.

- Inductors in series have the same current through them.

- "Looks" like a single inductor with larger inductance (length):

$$
\begin{gather}
i_{L_1}(t) = i_{L_2}(t) = i_{L_3}(t) = \ldots = i_{L_n}(t) \\
v_n(t) = L_n \frac{di_n(t)}{dt} \\
v(t) = \sum_{n} v_n(t) = \sum_{n} L_n \frac{di(t)}{dt} = \left( \sum_{n} L_n \right) \frac{di(t)}{dt}
\end{gather}
$$

$$
L_{eq} = \sum_{i} L_i
$$  

- Inductors in series have a similar relationship to resistors in series.

## Steady-State DC Response of Reactive Components

- Capacitors act like open circuits in steady-state DC.

$$
\begin{gather}
i_c(t) = C \frac{dV_c(t)}{dt} = 0 \quad \text{for constant } V_c(t) \\
\Rightarrow \quad V_c(t) = \text{constant} \\
\Rightarrow \quad I_c(t) = 0
\end{gather}
$$

- Inductors act like short circuits in steady-state DC.

$$
\begin{gather}
v_L(t) = L \frac{di_L(t)}{dt} = 0 \quad \text{for constant } i_L(t) \\
\Rightarrow \quad i_L(t) = \text{constant} \\
\Rightarrow \quad V_L(t) = 0
\end{gather}
$$

### Example 

Find $i_1$ at steady-state DC (long after the switch is closed).

![](images/reactive_dc_response.png){fig-align="center"}

$$
i_1 = \frac{V_s}{R_1} = \frac{10V}{10k\Omega} = 1 mA
$$

How do we do this?
