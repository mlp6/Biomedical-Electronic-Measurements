## Learning Objectives

- Define and describe the behavior of capacitors and inductors in DC and AC
circuits.

- Analyze circuits with capacitors and inductors in series and parallel.

- Understand the concept of reactance and impedance.

## Relevant Reading

Practical Electronics for Inventors, 4th Edition by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk:

- Chapter 2.23 (Theory)

- Chapter 3.6 (Caps in Circuits)

## Reactive Components

- To date, we have only considered resistors, which dissipate energy as heat, to
consume source power.

- Resistive components respond "instantaneously" to changes in voltage and
current, as defined by Ohm's Law.

- Reactive components, such as capacitors and inductors, **store** energy in
electric and magnetic fields, respectively.

- This storage of energy takes time, so reactive components do not respond
instantaneously to changes in voltage and current.  This means that circuits
with reactive components have **transient** and **steady-state** responses to
time-varying sources.

## Ideal Capacitors

- A capacitor is a device that stores energy in an electric field.

- Composed of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material
(dielectric) that contains dipoles that become polarized in the presence of an
electric field.

- Permititivity, Îµ, is a measure of how easily a material can become polarized.
($\epsilon_{air} = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$)

- Charge, Q, is stored on the plates of a capacitor:

  - Take a finite amount of time to charge/discharge.

  - Finite capacity to store charge.

- Capacitance, C, is the ratio of charge to voltage:
  
  $$
  C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} \quad \text{(Farads, F)}
  $$

## Capacitor Voltage-Current Relationship

$$
Q = CV \quad \Rightarrow \quad I = \frac{dQ}{dt} = C\frac{dV}{dt}
$$

- Capacitors have a "memory" since $i_c(t)$ depends on the rate of change of
the voltage across the capacitor (i.e., how much charge has accumulated for
storage over time).

- Capacitors are linear elements since differentiation is a linear operation.

- Capacitors block DC current in steady-state since $dV/dt = 0$ for constant voltage.

::: callout-tip
For a steady-state DC voltage, a capacitor acts like an open circuit.

::: callout-tip
For a time-varying voltage, an uncharged capacitor acts like a short circuit at the instant
the voltage changes.

## Capacitor Voltage-Current Temporal Relationship

$$
\int i_c(t) dt = C \int \frac{dV_c(t)}{dt} dt \quad \Rightarrow \quad V_c(t) = V_c(t_0) + \frac{1}{C} \int_{t_0}^{t} i_c(\tau) d\tau
$$

- The voltage across a capacitor at time $t$ depends on:

  - The initial voltage $V_c(t_0)$, and
  
  - The integral of the current over time.

  - $t_0$ is the time when the capacitor was last charged or discharged and this new change in current is being evaluated.
