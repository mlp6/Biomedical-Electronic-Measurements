## Learning Objectives

- Reinforce pwoer and energy flow in circuits

- Define Ohm's Law

- Define Kirchoff's Voltage and Current Laws

- Resistive Loads

- Voltage and Current Measurement Devices

## Review from Last Lecture

$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} \left[\frac{C}{s}\right] = [A] (Ampere)
$$

$$
V = \frac{dW}{dq} \left[\frac{J}{C}\right] = [V] (Volt)
$$

$$
P = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dW}{dq} \frac{dq}{dt} = VI \left[W = \frac{J}{s}\right]
$$

- Power is the capacity to do work per unit time, where:

$$
Work = Q \times V
$$

which is the transfer of energy associated with moving charge across a potential difference.

- Sources provide energy to a circuit ($P < 0$).

- Loads consume energy from a circuit ($P > 0$).

- Postive power is when postive current flows from $(+) -> (-)$ voltage drop across a circuit element:

## Power Source/Load Example

Given:

$$
\begin{gather}
P_1 = -100 W \\
P_2 = 50 W \\
P_3 = 30 W \\
v_1 = 10 V \\
v_2 = 5 V \\
i_3 = 6 A
\end{gather}
$$

We don't know what these circuit components are, but given power/voltage/current associated with them, we can determine if they are sources or loads, and solve for the unknown quantities.

### Circuit Element 1

Source or load?

### Solve for $i_1$
$$
\begin{gather}
P_1 = v_1 i_1 \\
-100 W = 10 V (i_1) \\
i_1 = -10 A
\end{gather}
$$

### What does this mean?

Element 1 is a **source**.

Does this make sense?
