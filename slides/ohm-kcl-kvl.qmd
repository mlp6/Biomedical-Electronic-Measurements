## Learning Objectives

- Reinforce pwoer and energy flow in circuits

- Define Ohm's Law

- Define Kirchoff's Voltage and Current Laws

- Resistive Loads

- Voltage and Current Measurement Devices

## Review from Last Lecture

$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} \left[\frac{C}{s}\right] = [A] (Ampere)
$$

$$
V = \frac{dW}{dq} \left[\frac{J}{C}\right] = [V] (Volt)
$$

$$
P = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dW}{dq} \frac{dq}{dt} = VI \left[W = \frac{J}{s}\right]
$$

- Power is the capacity to do work per unit time, where:

$$
Work = Q \times V
$$

which is the transfer of energy associated with moving charge across a potential difference.

- Sources provide energy to a circuit ($P < 0$).

- Loads consume energy from a circuit ($P > 0$).

- Postive power is when postive current flows from $(+) -> (-)$ voltage drop across a circuit element:

Given:

$$
\begin{gather}
P_1 = -100 W \\
P_2 = 50 W \\
P_3 = 30 W \\
v_1 = 10 V \\
v_2 = 5 V \\
i_3 = 6 A
\end{gather}
$$

We don't know what these circuit components are, but given power/voltage/current associated with them, we can determine if they are sources or loads, and solve for the unknown quantities.

### Circuit Element 1

Source or load?

### Solve for $i_1$
$$
\begin{gather}
P_1 = v_1 i_1 \\
-100 W = 10 V (i_1) \\
i_1 = -10 A
\end{gather}
$$

### What does this mean?

- Element 1 is a **source**!

- Does this make sense?

### Circuit Element 2

Source or load?

### Solve for $i_2$

$$
\begin{gather}
P_2 = v_w i_2 \\
50 W = 5 V (i_2) \\
i_2 = 10 A
\end{gather}
$$

### What does this mean?

Element 2 is a **load**!

## Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)

- Conservation of energy means that for a given node, **all current flowing in and out of the node must be conserved**.

$$
\begin{gather}
\Sigma i_{in} = \Sigma i_{out}
\end{gather}
$$

- For Node A, what currents are "in" and "out"?

- As drawn (arbitrary), both are "out", so:

$$
\begin{gather}
\Sigma i_{in} = 0 \\
\Sigma i_{out} = i_1 + i_2 = -10 A + 10 A = 0 ✅
\end{gather}
$$

- In this circuit, $i_1 = -i_2$, which makes sense because they are the same magnitude, but flowing in different directions relative.

## Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)

- Generalized form of current conservation at a node:

$$
\Sigma_{n=1}^N i_n = 0
$$

- You have to be very careful to correctly capture current direction ("in"/"out") and magnitude.

### Circuit Element 3

Source or load?

$$
v_3 = \frac{P_3}{i_3} = \frac{30 W}{6 A} = 5 V
$$

Positive current flow "down" a voltage drop, so load!

### Circuit Element 4

Source or load?  You tell me... do we know enough?

### Yes, we do!

- Conservation of energy!

- $\Sigma_n P_n = 0$

- $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 = 0$

- $P_4$ = 20 W (positive, so a load!)

### What are $v_4$ and $i_4$?

- Assume that wires in circuits are ideal conductors (i.e., no energy loss).

- $v_B$ = $v_C$ (same node)

- Apply KCL:

$$
\begin{gather}
i_{in} = i_{out} \\
i_2 + i_4 = i_3 \\
i_4 = i_3 - i_2 = 6 A - 10 A = -4 A \\
v_4 = \frac{P_4}{i_4} = \frac{20 W}{-4 A} = -5 V
\end{gather}
$$

### Did we have to solve for $i_4$?

- No!

- $v_B = v_C$ (ideal conductor assumption; same **node**)

- Circuit elements 3 & 4 share common node $D$.

- As drawn on the circuit:

$$
\begin{gather}
v_3 = v_B - v_D \\
v_4 = v_D - v_C = v_D - v_B = -v_3 = -5 V
\end{gather}
$$

- Then you can solve for $i_4 = \frac{P_4}{v_4} = \frac{20 W}{-5 V} = -4 A$.

## Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

- The last example demonstrated another fundamental circuit analysis law:

$$
\Sigma_{n=1}^{N} v_n = 0
$$

- For a closed loop of a circuit (continuous path of conduction), the sum of all voltage gains = sum of all voltage losses.

$$
\Sigma v_{source} = \Sigma v_{load}
$$

### Does our circuit obey KVL?

- We have 3 (not 2) closed loops:

    - $D \rightarrow A \rightarrow (B + C) \rightarrow D$

    $$
    \begin{gather}
    \Sigma v = 0 = -v_1 + v_2 - v_4\\
    0 = -10 V + 5 V - (-5 V) = 0 ✅ 
    \end{gather}
    $$

    - $D \rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow D$
    $$
    \begin{gather}
    \Sigma v = 0 = -v_1 + v_2 + v_3\\
    0 = -10 V + 5 V + 5 V = 0 ✅ 
    \end{gather}
    $$

    - $D \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D$

    $$
    \begin{gather}
    \Sigma v = 0 = -v_3 - v_4 \\
    0 = -5 V - (-5 V) = 0 ✅ 
    \end{gather}
    $$

### What happens if we reverse the loops?

- You tell me.

- Prove it.
