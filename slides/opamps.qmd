## Overview

- Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) are fundamental building blocks in analog electronics.

- They are used in various applications such as amplification, filtering, and mathematical operations, such as "comparison".

- They are characterized by high gain, high input impedance, and low output impedance.  Their application as a **buffer** is particularly important in preventing signal loading.

- They can be used in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations.  

  - With negative feedback, they can achieve precise gain control and stability.

  - With positive feedback, they can be used in applications like oscillators and comparators.

- They can perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation.

## Ideal Op-Amp Model

- An ideal op-amp has the following characteristics:

  - Infinite open-loop gain (A → ∞)

  - Infinite input impedance ($Z_{in}$ → ∞)

  - Zero output impedance ($Z_{out}$ = 0)

  - Infinite bandwidth (no frequency dependence)

  - Zero offset voltage (output is zero when inputs are equal)

- In practical applications, real op-amps deviate from these ideal characteristics, but the ideal model provides a useful approximation for analysis.

## Voltage Saturation

- Real op-amps have power supply limits that constrain the output voltage range.

- When the output voltage exceeds these limits, the op-amp saturates, resulting in distortion of the output signal.

- Saturation can be mitigated by ensuring that the input signals and feedback network are designed to keep the output within the linear operating range of the op-amp.

## Buffer / Voltage Follower

- A buffer, or voltage follower, is a configuration where the output voltage directly follows the input voltage.

- It is used to isolate different stages of a circuit, preventing loading effects and ensuring signal integrity.

- The voltage follower has a gain of 1 (unity gain) and provides high input impedance and low output impedance.

## Negative Feedback

- Negative feedback occurs when a portion of the output signal is fed back to the inverting input of the op-amp.

- This configuration stabilizes the gain and improves linearity.

- It can also reduce distortion and increase bandwidth.

::: callout-important
Negative feedback means that the op-amp will adjust its output to minimize the
difference between the inverting and non-inverting inputs.
