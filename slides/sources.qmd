## Superposition

::: {.callout-note title="Superposition Statement"}
- In a **linear** circuit containing $N$ sources, each branch voltage and
current is the linear sum of $N$ voltages and currents (i.e., each source
contributes to part of the total element current and voltage).

- Each source's contribution can be calculated by "eliminating" the contribution
of the other sources and solving for element currents/voltages.
:::

### "Eliminating" Sources

- "Eliminating" a source means removing its voltage or current contribution to the circuit.

- A **voltage sourse** can be eliminated by replacing it with a **short circuit**.  

    - Branch current can still be conducted.
    
    - Forcing no $\Delta$ V related to the voltage source.

- A **current source** can be eliminated by replacing it with an **open circuit**.

    - Voltage difference allowed between two nodes.
    
    - Blocking current from flowing from other sources because the eliminated current source *exclusively* dictactes that branch current.

### Superposition Example

::: callout-note
Solve for $i_3$ using source superposition.

- $V_S = 10 V$

- $R_1 = 200 \Omega$

- $R_2 = 200 \Omega$

- $R_3 = 100 \Omega$

- $I_S = 0.1 A$

$$
i_3 = i_{3_{V_S}} + i_{3_{I_S}}
$$
:::

### Step 1: Eliminate $I_S$; Solve for $i_{3_{V_S}}$

![](images/superposition_two_sources_eliminate_Is.png){fig-align="center"}

$$
i_{3_{V_S}} = \frac{V_S}{R_1+R_2+R_3} = 0.2 A
$$

::: callout-note
$i_{3_{V_S}}$ is the contribution to total $i_3$ from $V_S$.
:::

### Step 2: Eliminate $V_S$; Solve for $i_{3_{I_S}}$

::: callout-tip
While any circuit analysis techinque we have used to date is fair game, current division resonates with me...
:::

$$
I_{3_{I_S}} = \frac{v_A}{R_2+R_3} = -I_S\left(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2+R_3}\right) = -0.04 A
$$

### Step 3: Sum Contributions from $I_S$ and $V_S$

![](images/superposition_two_sources.png){fig-align="center"}

$$
i_3 = i_{3_{V_S}} + i_{3_{I_S}} = 0.02 A + (-0.04 A) = -0.02 A
$$

### Let's revisit the "super mesh" circuit...

- Let's walk through the approach together...

## Equivalent Circuits

::: callout-important
Each "block" (physical or functional) of a circuit can be represented by a
2-terminal equivalent circuit, composed of a single source and resistance that
completely captures the $i-v$ characteristics of that block.

- If that single source is a voltage source, then it is known as a **Thevenin
source** equivalent.

- If that single source is a current source, then it is known as a **Norton
source** equivalent.
:::

## Thevenin Equivalent Sources

::: {.callout-note title="Thevenin Theorem"}
When a circuit is viewed from the perspective of the load, any source network composed of ideal voltage/current sources and linear resistors (i.e., defined by Ohm's law), can be replaced by an equivalent circuit with:

1. An ideal voltage source ($V_T$), and

2. An equivalent resistance ($R_T$).
:::

![](images/thevenin.png){fig-align="center"}

How do we solve for $V_T$ and $R_T$?

### Step 1: Find the equivalent resistance

Find the **equivalent resistance** as "seen" by the terminals of that source block.

a. Remove the load from the terminals of the block.

b. Eliminate all independent voltage and current sources.

::: callout-note
To date, we have only dealth with independent voltage and current sources (i.e., their source voltage or current values are not dependent on other voltages/currents in the circuit).
:::

c. Compute the equivalent resistance with the load removed.

### Step 1: Example

![](images/thevenin_R_T.png){fig-align="center"}

### Step 2: Find the equivalent source voltage

Solve for the equivalent Thevenin source voltage, which is equal to the terminal
voltage when the terminals are "open" (i.e., no load is attached to them).

a. Remove the load from the terminals (create an "open" load condition).

b. Keep all sources.

c. Solve for $V_T = $V_{{ab}_{Open Circuit}}$ 

### Back to our example...

![](images/thevenin_V_T.png){fig-align="center"}

$$
V_T = V_{ab} = V_B = v_s \left(\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}\right)
$$

Let's convince ourselves that $i_L$ is the same for both circuits...
