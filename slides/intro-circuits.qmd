## Learning Objectives

* What are circuits?
* How does electric circuit analysis apply to other biomedical systems?
* Circuit analysis conventions

## Circuit

Circuits are interconnection of elements (sources and loads).

::: {.callout-note title="Question"}
What are common sources and loads in electronic circuits?
:::

## Sources

* Voltage differentials -> EMF -> electric current (moving electrons) to flow through "closed circuit" paths.

* The potential energy in the source to move electrons to the load, where that energy is either **dissipated** or **stored**.

## Biomedical Circuit Correlates

### Cardiovascular

* **Source**: Heart (pressure differential)
* **Load**: 
  * Circulatory system 
  * Organs 
  * Resistance & elasticity (storage of energy)
* **Current**: Volumetric Flow Rate

### Cardiovascular Analogy

How does sympathetic and parasympathetic tone modulate systemic resistance and pressure?
:::

### Respiratory

* **Source**: Diaphragm & Intercostal Muscles
* **Load**: Airways / Lungs
* **Current**: Volumetric Airflow Rate

## What is charge?

$$
\begin{gather}
q_e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} C (Coulomb)\\
q_p = -q_e
\end{gather}
$$

## What is current?

### Current
**Current** is the time rate change of charge passing through a defined area.

$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} \left[\frac{C}{s}\right] = [A] (Ampere)
$$

### Polarity Conventions

* (+) direction of current flow represents flow of (+) charges (i.e., not electrons)

### SI Units

Coulombs and amperes are SI units.

| Power of 10 | Prefix |
| ----------- | ------ |
| $\times 10^{12}$ | T (Tera) |
| $\times 10^9$ | G (Giga) |
| $\times 10^6$ | M (Mega) |
| $\times 10^3$ | k (kilo) |
| $\times 10^{-3}$ | m (milli) |
| $\times 10^{-6}$ | $\mu$ (micro) |
| $\times 10^{-9}$ | n (nano) |
| $\times 10^{-12}$ | p (pico) |

### Common Current Magnitudes

| Description | Approx. Magnitude |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Circuit breaker limits / house electrical wires max | 10-20 A |
| Home circuit breaker total | 200-300 A |
| Hairdryer | < 10 A |
| Car Battery Max | 100s A |
| Laptop Battery | < 1 A |
| Cellphone Battery | 10 mA (idle) <br> 3 A (cell, camera) | 
| Nerve Membrane Current | pA |

## What is voltage?

A voltage differential represents the energy ($dW$) available in flowing charge ($dq$), avialalbe as stored potential energy in a source.

$$
V = \frac{dW}{dq} \left[\frac{J}{C}\right] = [V] (Volt)
$$

### Common Voltage Magnitudes

| Description | Approx. Magnitude |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Wall Outlet | 110-240 V (AC) |
| Transmission Line | kV-MV |
| Lightning | ~100 MV |
| Alkaline Battery Cell | ~1.5 V |
| Nerve Action Potential | ~75 mV |

::: callout-important
Voltage is a **relative** quantity; absolute voltage does not exist!
:::

## What is power?

Power represents the rate at which work can be done (i.e., energy / unit time).

$$
P = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dW}{dq} \frac{dq}{dt} = VI
$$

### What do the units look like?

$$
\left[\frac{J}{C} \frac{C}{s}\right] = \left[\frac{J}{s}\right] = [W] (Watt)
$$

## What happens to power?

Circuit elements my absorb (dissipate or store) [load] or provide [source] power.

### Sign Conventions

$P < 0$: energy is provided to the circuit (source)
$P > 0$: energy is dissipated / stored (load)

Power *dissipated* by a circuit element (load) is (+) when (+) current ($I$) flows from a (+) -> (-) voltage (V).
