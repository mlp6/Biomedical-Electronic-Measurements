## Overview

Unlike our filter analysis, which focused on steady-state sinusoidal inputs,
transient analysis examines how circuits respond to time-varying signals,
especially during switching events. This is crucial for understanding real-world
circuit behavior, as many applications involve non-sinusoidal waveforms.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how voltage and current change over time in response to switched DC
sources in first-order, passive reactive circuits.

- Evaluate transient response, analytically, using differential equations and
initial conditions.

- Numerically simulate transient response using SPICE.

## Switched RC Circuit

- Close the switch at $t = t_0$.

- Evaluate the voltage across the capacitor $v_C(t)$ for $t \geq t_0$.

## How can we model a closing switch mathematically?

- Unit step function $u(t) = \begin{cases} 0, & t < 0 \\ 1, & t \geq 0 \end{cases}$o

- Can scale and shift the unit step function to model a closing switch at $t = t_0$:

$$
V_A u(t - t_0) = \begin{cases} 0, & t < t_0 \\ V_A, & t \geq t_0 \end{cases}
$$

- In our example circuit:

    - Closing the switch at $t = t_0$ can be modeled as $V_S\,u(t - t_0)$.

    - Opening the switch at $t = t_1$ can be modeled as $V_S\,u(t - t_0) - V_S\,u(t - t_1)$.

## Solving the Switched RC Circuit

- We cannot use phasors here because the input is not steady-state sinusoidal.

- Instead, we will use the IV relationships for resistors, capacitors and inductors to setup differential equations.

    - KCL & KVL will be used to setup the equations.

    - Initial conditions will be used to solve for the constants of integration.

- These differential equations will have **general forms** with known solutions that can be used to simplify the analsis, and we will leverage numerical solution using SPICE and `scipy` in your Jupyter notebooks.

## Reminder: IV Relationships for Reactive Elements

- Capacitor

$$
\begin{gather}
i_C(t) = C \frac{d v_C(t)}{d t} \\
v_C(t) = v_C(t_0) + \frac{1}{C} \int_{t_0}^{t} i_C(t) dt \\
\end{gather}
$$

- Inductor

$$
\begin{gather}
v_L(t) = L \frac{d i_L(t)}{d t} \\
i_L(t) = i_L(t_0) + \frac{1}{L} \int_{t_0}^{t} v_L(t) dt \\
\end{gather}
$$


## Back to our Switched RC Circuit

![](images/switch_RC.png){fig-align="center"}

KVL around the loop for $t \geq t_0$:

$$
\begin{gather}
-V_S(t) + v_R(t) + v_C(t) = 0 \\
v_R(t) = i(t) R \\
i(t) = C \frac{d v_C(t)}{d t} \\
v_R(t) = R C \frac{d v_C(t)}{d t} \\
-v_S(t) + R C \frac{d v_C(t)}{d t} + v_C(t) = 0 \\
\Rightarrow R C \frac{d v_C(t)}{d t} + v_C(t) = V_S(t)
\end{gather}
$$

## RC General Form Differential Equation

The general form of the first-order linear differential equation for an RC circuit is:

$$
\tau \frac{d v_o(t)}{d t} + v_o(t) = \kappa\,v_i(t)
$$

- $\tau = R C$ is the time constant of the circuit

- $\kappa$ is the steady-state gain of the circuit 

    - $\kappa = 1$ for a passive series RC circuit

## RC General Form Solution

The solution to the general form differential equation for an RC circuit is:

$$
v_o(t) = v_n(t) + v_f(t)
$$

- $v_n(t)$ is the natural response (homogeneous solution)

    - $\tau \frac{d v_n(t)}{d t} + v_n(t) = 0$

    - "Homogeneous" part of the solution (means the input is zero (circuit is not driven))

    - Solution Form: $v_n(t) = A e^{-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}}$

    - $A$ is a constant determined by initial conditions

- $v_f(t)$ is the forced response (particular solution)

    - $\tau \frac{d v_f(t)}{d t} + v_f(t) = \kappa\,v_i(t)$

    - $v_f(t)$ depends on the form of $v_i(t)$ (how the circuit is driven)

## Lets solve for the natural response...

$$
\begin{gather}
\textrm{Remove the forced response:} v_i(t) = 0 \\
R C \frac{d v_n(t)}{d t} + v_n(t) = 0 \\
v_n(t) = A e^{st} \textrm{($s$ is a constant)}\\
R C A s e^{st} + A e^{st} = 0 \\
(R C s + 1) A e^{st} = 0 \\
\end{gather}
$$

- $A e^{st} \neq 0$ for all $t$

- Characteristic Equation: $R C s + 1 = 0 \Rightarrow s = -\frac{1}{R C} = -\frac{1}{\tau}$

- Natural Response: $v_n(t) = A e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} = A e^{-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}}$

- $A$ is determined by the initial condition $v_n(t_0)$

## Now onto the forced response solution...

If $v_i(t)$ is a DC source that is switched on at $t = t_0$:

$$
v_i(t) = V_A u(t - t_0) = \begin{cases} 0, & t < t_0 \\ V_A, & t \geq t_0 \end{cases}
$$

$$
\begin{gather}
R C \frac{d v_f(t)}{d t} + v_f(t) = V_A \\
v_f(t) = V_A \textrm{(constant!)} \\
\frac{d v_f(t)}{d t} = 0 \\
R C (0) + V_A = V_A \\
V_A = V_A \\
\end{gather}
$$

## Lets put our complete solution together...

$$
\begin{gather}
v_o(t) = v_n(t) + v_f(t) \\
v_o(t) = A e^{-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}} + V_A \\
\end{gather}
$$

- $A$ is determined by the initial condition $v_o(t_0)$ (right before the switch is closed).

- Since the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously:

$$
\begin{gather}
v_C(t_0^-) = v_C(t_0^+) \Rightarrow v_C(t_0) = v_C(t_0^-) \\
A e^{-\frac{t_0 - t_0}{\tau}} + V_A = v_C(t_0^-) \\
A = v_C(t_0^-) - V_A \\
\end{gather}
$$

::: {.callout-important title="Complete Solution"}
$$
v_C(t) = \left(v_C(t_0^-) - V_A\right) e^{-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}} + V_A, \quad t \geq t_0
$$
