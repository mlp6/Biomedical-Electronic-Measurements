## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of complex impedance and how it extends the idea of
impedance to AC circuits with capacitors and inductors.

- Analyze AC circuits using complex impedance and phasor techniques.

- Apply complex impedance to solve for voltages and currents in circuits with
resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

## Phasors and Complex Numbers

- Phasors are a way to represent sinusoidal functions as complex numbers of **amplitude** and **phase** in the frequency domain.

- A sinusoidal voltage or current at a given, single frequency can be represented as:
$$
\begin{gather}
V_c(t) = V_A \cos(\omega t + \phi)  \\
V_c(t) = V_A \text{Re} \left\{ e^{j\omega t + \phi} \right\} \\
V_c(t) = \text{Re} \left\{ V_A e^{j\phi} e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
\bar{V} = V_A e^{j\phi} = V_A \angle \phi \\
\end{gather}
$$    
where $V_A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and
$\phi$ is the phase angle.  The phasor $\tilde{V}$ is a complex number.

---

- The time dependence $e^{j\omega t}$ is often omitted in phasor notation, as it is
understood to be present.

- Phasors allow us to use complex algebra to analyze AC circuits, simplifying the
calculation of voltages and currents.

---

$$
\begin{align}
I_c & = C \frac{d V_c}{dt} = C \frac{d}{dt} \left( V_A \cos(\omega t + \phi) \right) \\
 & = -\omega C V_A \sin(\omega t + \phi) = \omega C V_A \cos\left(\omega t + \phi + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\end{align}
$$
The phasor representation of the current is:
$$
\bar{I}_c = j \omega C \bar{V}_c
$$

- The phase difference between the voltage and current in a capacitor is
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (90 deg), with the current leading the voltage,
which is represented with the imaginary unit $j$ in the phasor equation.

## Does a Resistor Have Complex Impedance?

- Short answer: No.

$$
\begin{gather}
v_R(t) = R i_R(t) \\
v_R(t) = Re\left\{ \bar{V}_R e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
\bar{V}_R = V_A e^{j\phi} \\
i_R(t) = Re\left\{ \bar{I}_R e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
\bar{I}_R = \frac{V_A}{R} e^{j\phi} \\
\end{gather}
$$

## What does this look like on the complex plane?

- $\bar{V}_R$ and $\bar{I}_R$ are in phase.

- Amplitude is governed by Ohm's law: $V_A = R I_A$.

## Complex Impedance of a Capacitor

$$
\begin{gather}
v_c(t) = Re\left\{ \bar{V}_c e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
i_c(t) = C \frac{d v_c(t)}{dt} \\
i_c(t) = C Re\left\{ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \bar{V}_c e^{j\omega t} \right) \right\} \\
i_c(t) = C Re\left\{ j \omega \bar{V}_c e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
i_c(t) = Re\left\{ j \omega C \bar{V}_c e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
\bar{I}_c = j \omega C \bar{V}_c \\
\bar{V}_c = \frac{1}{j \omega C} \bar{I}_c
\end{gather}
$$

---

::: {.callout-note title="Complex Impedance of a Capacitor"}
The complex impedance ($Z_c$) of a capacitor is defined as the ratio of the phasor
voltage to the phasor current:

$$
Z_c = \frac{\bar{V}_c}{\bar{I}_c} = \frac{1}{j \omega C}
$$
:::

- Larger capacitance ($C$) leads to longer charging times.

- Higher frequency ($\omega$) represents more rapid changes in voltage, meaning
less time to charge in each phase of a cycle, so lower impedance to current
flow.

- The $j$ in the denominator indicates a phase shift of -90 degrees (current
leads voltage).

- The impedance is purely imaginary, indicating that the capacitor does not
dissipate energy but rather stores it in the electric field.

- This frequency-dependent behavior will be the foundation for designing filters.

## $Z_c$ in the Time Domain

$$
\begin{gather}
\bar{V}_c = \frac{\bar{I}_c}{j \omega C}  = -j \frac{\bar{I}_c}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{\omega C} e^{-j \frac{\pi}{2}} (\bar{I}_c e^{j \phi}) \\
\bar{V}_c = \frac{I_c}{\omega C} e^{j(\phi - \frac{\pi}{2})} \\
\end{gather}
$$

- Capacitor voltage **lags** current by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (90 deg).

## Example: RC Circuit with a Switch

![](images/switch_RC.png){fig-align="center"}

- The switch is closed at $t=0$, connecting the voltage source to the series RC circuit.

$$
\begin{gather}
v_C|_{t=0} = 0 \\
i_C = \frac{V_S}{R} \\
\end{gather}
$$

- The capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, so it starts at 0 V and
behaves like a short circuit for an instant until it starts to accumulate
charge.

- As time evolves, the capacitor charges, and its voltage increases, reducing the
current through the circuit.

## Complex Impedance of an Inductor

$$
\begin{gather}
v_L(t) = L \frac{d i_L(t)}{dt} \\
v_L(t) = L \frac{d}{dt} Re\left\{ \bar{I}_L e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
v_L(t) = L Re\left\{ j \omega \bar{I}_L e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
v_L(t) = Re\left\{ j \omega L \bar{I}_L e^{j\omega t} \right\} \\
\bar{V}_L = j \omega L \bar{I}_L \\
\bar{I}_L = \frac{1}{j \omega L} \bar{V}_L \\
\end{gather}
$$

::: {.callout-note title="Complex Impedance of an Inductor"}
The complex impedance ($Z_L$) of an inductor is defined as the ratio of the phasor
voltage to the phasor current:

$$
Z_L = j \omega L = \frac{\bar{V}_L}{\bar{I}_L}
$$
:::

- Larger inductance ($L$) means more opposition to changes in current.

- Higher frequency ($\omega$) means that transient voltage changes occur more
rapidly, leading to greater opposition to current flow.

---

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{V}_L & = j \omega L \bar{I}_L = j \omega L (I_L e^{j\phi}) \\
& = \omega L I_L e^{\frac{\pi}{2}} e^{j\phi} \\
& = \omega L I_L e^{j(\phi + \frac{\pi}{2})} \\
\end{align}
$$

- The $j$ indicates a phase shift of +90 degrees (voltage leads current).   

- The impedance is purely imaginary, indicating that the inductor does not
dissipate energy but rather stores it in the magnetic field.

## Example: RL Circuit with a Switch

![](images/switch_RL.png){fig-align="center"}

When the switch closes at $t=0$:

- $v_L$ = $V_S$ (initially behaves like an open circuit)

- $i_L$ = 0 A (initially no current through the inductor)
