## Overview

The **frequency response** of a circuit is a measure of the variation of a
load-related voltage/current signal as a function of the frequency content of
the source signal.

::: {.callout-note title="Goal"}
Our goal is to evaluate the modulation of an input (voltage) signal by a circuit with
frequency-dependent behavior leading to a frequency-dependent output (voltage) signal.

## Circuit Block Diagram

Generalized circuit block diagram with a source (input signal), a filter (circuit with frequency-dependent behavior), and a load (output signal).

## Transfer Function

- A **transfer function** is a mathematical representation of the relationship
between the input and output of a system as a function of frequency.  

- It describes how a filter modifies the amplitude and phase of the input signal
to produce the output signal.

$$
\bar{H}(j\omega) = \frac{\bar{V}_{out}(j\omega)}{\bar{V}_{in}(j\omega)}
$$

- Complex quantity

- Dimensionless

- Function of frequency ($\omega$)

## Interpretting a Transfer Function

- $\bar{V}_{L}(j\omega)$ will be an **amplitude-modulated** and **phase-modulated** version of $\bar{V}_{S}(j\omega)$.

$$
\begin{gather}
V_{L} e^{j\phi_L} = |H|e^{j\angle H} V_{S} e^{j\phi_S} = |H| V_{S} e^{j(\phi_S + \angle H)} \\
V_{L} = |H| V_{S} \\
\phi_L = \angle H + \phi_S
\end{gather}
$$

### Example: FM Radio

- Input/Source: all the stations broadcast span a wide range of frequencies in the FM band (88-108 MHz).

- Desired Output/Load: a single station (e.g., 101.1 MHz).

- Draw:

  - Input signal: multiple frequencies

  - Output signal: single frequency

  - Transfer function: band-pass filter centered at 101.1 MHz

### Example: Audio Equalizer

- Input/Source: music signal with a wide range of frequencies (bass, midrange, treble).

- Desired Output/Load: enhanced bass and treble frequencies.

- Draw:

  - Input signal: full spectrum

  - Output signal: enhanced bass and treble

  - Transfer functions: low-pass and high-pass filters
