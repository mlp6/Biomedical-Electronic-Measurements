## Learning Objectives

- Review sinusoidal signals and their properties.

- Root mean square (RMS) values of sinusoidal signals.

- Complex numbers and Euler's formula.

- Phasor representation of sinusoidal signals.

## Sinusoidal Source Signal

- A sinusoidal voltage source can be represented as:

$$ 
v(t) = V_{A} \sin(2 \pi f t + \phi) = V_{A} \sin(\omega t + \phi) = V_{A} \sin(2 \pi (t/T) + \phi)
$$

- Where:
  - $V_{A}$ is the amplitude (peak value) of the signal.
  - $f$ is the frequency in Hertz (Hz).
  - $\omega = 2 \pi f$ is the angular frequency in radians per second (rad/s).
  - $T = 1/f$ is the period of the signal in seconds (s).
  - $\phi$ is the phase angle in radians.

- Lets draw this...

## Complex Plane Representation

- We can represent a fixed frequency sinusoidal signal as a rotating vector in
the complex plane.
  - The horizontal axis represents the real part (cosine component).
  - The vertical axis represents the imaginary part (sine component).
  - The length of the vector represents the amplitude $V_{A}$.
  - The angle of the vector with respect to the horizontal axis represents the
  phase angle $\phi$.
  - As time progresses, the vector rotates counterclockwise at an angular
  velocity $\omega$.
  - One full rotation corresponds to one period $T$ of the sinusoidal signal.

- Lets draw this...

## Euler's Formula and Complex Exponentials

- Euler's formula: 

$$
e^{j\theta} = \cos(\theta) + j \sin(\theta)
$$ 

- We can express the sinusoidal signal as the imaginary part of a complex exponential:

$$
v(t) = \text{Im} \{ V_{A} e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} \}
$$

- We can also express the (cos)sinusoidal signal as the real part of a complex exponential:

$$
v(t) = \text{Re} \{ V_{A} e^{j(\omega t + \phi - \pi/2)} \}
$$

- What does this look like on the complex plane?

## Power in Sinusoidal Signals

- Why not just use average value?

  - The average value of a sinusoidal signal over one period is zero, regardless of frequency or amplitude.

  - This is because the positive and negative halves cancel out.

  - Therefore, average value is not a good measure of the signal's power.

- Does this make sense?

- Instead, we use the root mean square (RMS) value.

## Calculating RMS Value

$$
V_{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T [V_A \sin(\omega t + \phi)]^2 dt} 
$$

$$
P_R(t) = i_R v_R = \frac{v_R^2}{R} = \frac{V_A^2 \sin^2(\omega t + \phi)}{R}
$$

Let's calculate the average power over one period:

$$
P_{avg} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T P_R(t) dt = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \frac{V_A^2 \sin^2(\omega t + \phi)}{R} dt = \frac{V_A^2}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \sin^2(\omega t + \phi) dt
$$

Since the integral of $\sin^2$ over one period is $T/2$, we have:

$$
P_{avg} = \frac{V_A^2}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{T} \cdot \frac{T}{2} = \frac{V_A^2}{2R}
$$

## RMS Value and Power

$$P_{avg} = \frac{V_{RMS}^2}{R}$$

::: callout-important
$V_{RMS}$ is the equivalent DC voltage that would deliver the same average power to a resistive load as the AC voltage.

## How does $V_{RMS}$ relate to $V_A$?

$$
\begin{gather}
V(t) = V_A \cos(\omega t + \phi) \\
V_{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T V_A^2 \cos^2(\omega t + \phi) dt} \\
= V_A \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \cos^2(\omega t + \phi) dt} \\
\textrm{Remember that:} \cos^2(x) = \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2} \\
= V_A \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \frac{1 + \cos(2(\omega t + \phi))}{2} dt} \\
= V_A \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \cdot \frac{T}{2}} \\
= \frac{V_A}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{gather}
$$

$$
V_{RMS} = \frac{V_A}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707 V_A
$$

What does this "look like"?
