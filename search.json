    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nSafety is Always First, Cleanliness a close second\n\n\nSafety always comes first in lab. To that end, you are expected to follow the rules in this document. Failure to do so may result in revocation of laboratory privileges, reduction of your course grade, and possible withdrawal from your course. Understanding risks and learning to work safely in the laboratory are an important part of your education.\nBefore entering lab, your safety training must be current. You need Duke’s Occupational and Environmental Safety Office’s:\n\nFire/Life Safety, and\nLaboratory Safety-General\n\ntraining modules. We know that you may have done this training before, but it expires in one year, and you must be current through the end of the semester.\nMost accidents are the result of a series of failures. That said, most accidents are preventable. You are responsible for your safety and the safety of those around you. The vast majority of accidents involve some combination of inattention, carelessness, horseplay, impairment, broken tools, and lack of knowledge. All of these factors can be mitigated and it’s your job to do so.\nYou are responsible for keeping the lab clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFailure to keep a clean workspace can result in a lower grade for you and your team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you or someone else in lab needs immediate medical attention, call 911.\n\n\nIn case you need to report your location, you are in CIEMAS B209. Non-emergent problems, call 681-WELL (681-9355). If you are injured in lab, you must let an instructor/TA/lab staff member know as soon as possible. Lab staff after-hours phone number is on the contact cards posted outside every lab door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep these points in mind… - In an emergency, call 911. Location: CIEMAS B209\n\nIn the event of a non-emergent injury, seek medical attention and let an instructor/TA/lab staff know within 12 hours.\nFind the emergency exits.\nNever work alone. Two or more people must be present and able to see and hear each other.\nInspect every tool before use. Remove broken tools from service, place them on the broken tools shelf at the back of the room, and notify lab staff.\nWear safety glasses when appropriate. This includes, but is not limited to, activities such as soldering, sanding, filing, hammering, cutting, and drilling.\nWear hearing protection when using noisy tools such as drills and the Dremel tool. Ear buds or music headphones are not sufficient hearing protection.\nNever work impaired. If you are tired, stressed, in a rush, or impaired in any other way then do not work in lab. Go home and recuperate.\nTie back long hair to keep it away from tools.\nClosed-toe shoes must be worn in the lab. Long trousers are preferred.\nProperly secure materials. Clamps, vises and portable worktables are available.\nDon’t force anything. If the job requires significant force, you’re doing it wrong.\nKeep food and drink out of the lab!\nPower down equipment when finished with it.\nA fire extinguisher is outside the door.\nWash your hands before leaving lab.\nBits of unused solder, wire and lead trimmings all go in a “Solder Scrap” container.\nAnything contaminated with solder paste (wipes, boards, applicators) goes in a “Solder Scrap” container.\nOther hazardous waste dealt with on a case by case basis; ask lab staff for help.\nPut tools away, in the right place. Tool drawers are labeled, but if you’re unsure where to put a tool, ask your TA/lab staff.\nDo not hoard parts or tools.\nThis bears repeating: Take the parts you need, but only the parts you need. Do not hoard parts. If you see a part becoming scarce, let lab staff know so they can re-order.\nBenches are for temporary use only. Leave no trace that you were at the bench when you leave for the day. Rarely, with approval, a bench can be claimed for the semester.\nAny and all paint must be pre-approved by an instructor/TA/lab staff. Unapproved paint on projects will result in a lower grade. (Spray paint indoors is never approved.)\nA representative from your group is expected to participate in weekly cleaning. Your instructor will give you the schedule.\nPlace a cover on the bench for messy work. Chucks and Ram Board are available for this.\nLab staff have a collection of good soldering tips and fine tools (e.g. tweezers). If you have need for something better than you can find in lab, ask lab staff.",

All lecture slides/presented content will be made availabe online (Canvas). Our classroom this semester is not equipped for Panopto recording, so students who miss lecture will be responsible for getting lecture materials from fellow students.\nParticipation on Ed Discussion is also encouraged, in the form of:\n\nAsking questions about the course material (ideally, publicly, so that others can benefit (Anonymous okay))\nAnswering questions from other students\nSharing interesting articles or resources related to the course material",

    "text": "Assignments & Grading\n\nGrading\nFundamental knowledge will be assessed with regular problem sets and online quizzes. There are important guidelines to follow when submitting your problem sets electronically to Gradescope.\nLab exercises, as described above, are mandatory to pass the class. Lab exercises will synthesize your theoretical and analytic circuit analysis skills with practical circuit debugging and testing. Lab exercises will include pre-lab exercises and post-lab submissions of data collection and analysis from the lab exercises.\nThere will be three midterm exams and a final lab practical will be held during the final exam period in the lab.\n\nGrade Distribution\n\n\nGrade Category\nRelative Percentage\n\n\n\n\nProblem Sets & Quizzes\n20%\n\n\nLabs\n15% (pre-lab) + 15% (post-lab) = 30%\n\n\nMidterms\n3 × 10% = 30%\n\n\nLab Practical\n20%\n\n\n\nAll assignment grades will be posted to Gradescope (and linked to the Canvas gradebook) throughout the semester to track your performance.\n\n\nCourse Grade\nThis course is not “curved” (i.e., a distribution of grades will not be enforced), and a traditional grading scheme will be used (e.g., 90-93 = A-, 94-97 = A, 97-100 = A+). Participation throughout the semester will influence rounding up/down for fractional grades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFailing the course can happen with a cummulative score \\(&lt;\\) 65 (D) or more than one unexcused lab absence.\n\n\n\n\nRegrades\nAny regrading requests need to be made within one week of grades for a given assignment being released. You must make the request via Gradescope and provide a description of why you feel a regrade is appropriate. Requesting a regrade could lead to additional loss of credit when an assignment is re-evaluated.\nSome assignments will have an opportunity to be resubmitted based on grading feedback at the discretion of Dr. Palmeri.\n\n\nLate Policy / SDAO Accomodations\nLate submission windows will be available for all assignments, minus the in-person lab sessions and the final lab practical, and should be used to accomodate acute illness, travel, high workload from other classes and other unforeseen circumstances. This late submission window can be utilized without penalty and without prior approval.\nStudents with SDAO accomodations for extended time on assignments can use this extended late submission window for all assignments.\nAny assignments submitted after the late submission window will only be accepted for partial credit at the discretion of Dr. Palmeri or if prior approval was sought before the original (not extended) due date.",

That being said, all of the work that you submit must be generated by you and reflect your understanding of the material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll resources used in your assignment submissions that were developed by another person or company must be properly acknowledged.\n\n\n\n\nCan I use AI?\nThe use of artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing resource / tool in engineering. In software development, there are many levels of AI-assitance available. Such form of assistance include the IntelliCode tools and GitHub CoPilot (free to students through the GitHub Education program). These tools can be leveraged to help with coding syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nYou are strongly cautioned to not rely on these tools for solving circuit analysis problems, as these tools will not be available for your midterm exams and final lab practical. They are best used to help complete code syntax in this class.",
