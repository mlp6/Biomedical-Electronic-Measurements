# TODO / NOTES

- [ ] Update the [Makefile](Makefile) to compile all of the `circuitikz` images
  and clean things up.  MAYBE CONVERT TO KICAD SCHEMATICS??

- [ ] Setup semester-long calendar

- Lecture attendance suffered at the end of the semester.  Consider having more
participation-based credit and make in-class activities have higher yield for
the students (e.g., complete some project tasks in class to get feedback).

## Slides

- [ ] Organize slide images by lecture (not monolithic directory)

- [ ] Add input/output impedance to resistive loading, for example, real source
  resistance and designed voltage divider.

## Labs

- Final project conflicted w/ exam 03 and was challenging to have students
present during reading period / final exam block.  Pivot this to be the final
lab exercise.

- Reduce number of power supplies needed in final project.

- Clarify if lab "reports" should be done individually or with partner(s).

## Problems Sets

- Traditional problem sets sucked; pivot to more of the mini-projects.  Maybe
leverage KiCad even sooner for ability to simulate to validate analytic circuit
analysis.

## Exams

- In-class exam was a bummer; take-home mini-projects were a win.
