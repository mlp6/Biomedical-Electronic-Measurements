## Objectives

- Build and analyze inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, characterizing:

  - Gain, 
  
  - Phase shift, and 
  
  - Saturation.

- Build and analyze an active low-pass filter.

- Build and analyze a summing amplifier.

## Background

Please review all of the lecture content on [operational amplifiers](../slides/opamps.qmd).

## Procedure

### 1. Inverting Amplifier

![Inverting Amplifier Circuit](images/opamps/inverting_amp.png){fig-align="center"}

- Build the circuit above. 

  - Use $R_i$ = 2.7 kΩ, $R_f$ = 4.7 kΩ.  
  
  - The input should be a 0.1 $V_{pp}$ sine wave at 1 kHz. 
  
  - The op-amp should be powered with ±12 V.  
  
::: callout-note
The $0.1 \mu F$ capacitors are for power supply decoupling, which helps
stabalize the power supply lines to the chip.  

You should have these capacitors physically be as close to the op-amp power pins as possible.
:::

::: callout-tip
The pin-out for the DIP-8 package for this chip is available in the
[datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lf353.pdf).
:::

::: callout-note
Opamps are active devices and must always have a source of power.  Many
schematics, including those that follow in this course, omit the power supply
connections because they are assumed.
:::

::: callout-warning
Opamps can be damaged by applying the wrong voltages to terminals. A good idea
is to build the circuit with the power supply output turned off. When you turn
on the power supply, check the supply voltages and currents. If they don't look
correct, turn off the power supply output until you've corrected your problem.
Each LF353 opamp should draw about 4 mA from each supply.

1. Experimentally determine the voltage gain of this inverting circuit by
capturing both the input and output signals on your oscilloscope and showing
relevant measurements.

1. What is the phase relationship between the input and output signals, and how
does this compare to the nominal value?

1. Compare the experimentally determined gain with the nominal values from the
components in your circuit.  Discuss any differences.

1. Replace $R_f =100\,k\Omega$ and calculate the nominal and
experimentally-measured voltage gains.  Again, discuss any differences.

1. For $R_f = 100\,k\Omega$, what is the maximum input voltage amplitude you can apply
before the output signal becomes saturated?  Explain why this happens.

1. Demonstrate saturation on your oscilloscope by adjusting the input voltage
amplitude to 10% greater than the threshold you specified in the previous step.

### 2. Non-Inverting Amplifier

- Build the circuit above. 

  - Apply a 0.1 $V_{pp}$, 1 kHz sine wave to the input. 
  
  - Let $R_i = 560\,\Omega$ and $R_f = 150\,\Omega$.

### 3. Active Low-Pass Filter

![Active Low-Pass Filter Circuit](images/opamps/active_lpf.png){fig-align="center"}

- Build the circuit above. 
  - $R_f = R_i~= 3.3\,k\Omega$ and $C_f = 470\,nF$. 
  
  - Use the function generator to apply a 1 $V_{pp}$ sine wave at 1 kHz.
  
::: callout-tip
This circuit sometimes misbehaves when it does not have proper decoupling
capacitors. Have the lab staff check your circuit and tell you about decoupling
capacitors after you build this circuit.

1. Capture a screenshot of the circuit's input and output signals.
	
1. Change the input signal to a 1 $V_{pp}$ triangular wave at 1 kHz. Capture a screenshot of the circuit's input and output signals.

1. Comment on the relationship between input and output voltages. Explain what you observe. 

1. Repeat all of the input waveforms (sine, triangle, square) at 100 Hz. Capture
screenshots of the circuit's input and output signals for each waveform and
comment on the relationship between input and output voltages. Explain what you
observe, and compare/contrast with the 1 kHz waveform and your insights in this
circuit acting as an active low-pass filter.

### 4. Summing Amplifier

![Summing Amplifier Circuit](images/opamps/summing_amp.png){fig-align="center"}

- Build the circuit above.

  -  $R_1 = R_2 = R_f = 10\,k\Omega$.

  - The op-amp should be powered with ±12 V.

- Apply a 0.25 $V_{pp}$, 1 kHz sine wave to the input $V_1$ and +0.25 V (DC) to input $V_2$.

1. Capture a screenshot of the circuit's sinusoidal input and output signals.

1. Derive the expected output voltage expression based on the input voltages and
resistor values to confirm your experimental results.  Note both amplitudes and
phase.

1. Without changing the input voltage signals, change the values of $R_1$,
$R_2$, and/or $R_f$ to achieve an output signal of $V_{out} = 0.5 \sin(2 \pi 1000 t + \pi) + 0.5 V$.  

    a. Capture a screenshot of the output signal.

    b. Show your calculations using these new resistor values to confirm your
    experimental results.
