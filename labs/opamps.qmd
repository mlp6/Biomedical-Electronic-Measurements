## Objectives

- Build and analyze inverting and non-inverting amplifiers.

  - Characterize gain, phase shift, and saturation.

- Build and analyze active low-pass and high-pass filters.

## Background

Please review all of the lecture content on [operational amplifiers](../slides/opamps.qmd).

## Procedure

### 1. Inverting Amplifier

![Inverting Amplifier Circuit](images/opamps/invert.png){fig-align="center"}

Build the circuit above. Use $R_1$ = 2.7 kΩ, $R_f$ = 4.7 kΩ.  The input should
be a 0.1 $V_{pp}$ sine wave at 1 kHz. The op-amp should be powered with ±12 V.

::: callout-tip
The pin-out for the DIP-8 package for this chip is available in the
[datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lf353.pdf).
:::

::: callout-note
Opamps are active devices and must always have a source of power.  Many
schematics, including those that follow in this course, omit the power supply
connections because they are assumed.
:::

::: callout-warning
Opamps can be damaged by applying the wrong voltages to terminals. A good idea
is to build the circuit with the power supply output turned off. When you turn
on the power supply, check the supply voltages and currents. If they don't look
correct, turn off the power supply output until you've corrected your problem.
Each LF353 opamp should draw about 4 mA from each supply.

1. Experimentally determine the voltage gain of this inverting circuit by
capturing both the input and output signals on your oscilloscope and showing
relevant measurements.

1. What is the phase relationship between the input and output signals, and how
does this compare to the nominal value?

1. Compare the experimentally determined gain with the nominal values from the
components in your circuit.  Discuss any differences.

1. Replace $R_f ~= 100 k\Omega$ and calculate the nominal and
experimentally-measured voltage gains.  Again, discuss any differences.

1. For $R_f = 100 k\Omega$, what is the maximum input voltage amplitude you can apply
before the output signal becomes saturated?  Explain why this happens.

1. Demonstrate saturation on your oscilloscope by adjusting the input voltage
amplitude to 10% greater than the threshold you specified in the previous step.
