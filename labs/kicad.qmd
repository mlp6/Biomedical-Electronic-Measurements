## Learning Objectives

- Create a schematic in KiCad
- Annotate and assign component values
- Set up and run a SPICE simulation
- Analyze simulation results

## Voltage Divider Circuit

### Capture the Schematic

- Create a new KiCad project.
- Fill in the schematic metadata that is populated in the right foot of the sheet.
- Create the circuit shown below using the schematic editor.  Note that all of the sources chosen are SPICE DC sources.

### Simulate Maximum Power Transfer

In a recent problem set, you analytically solved for the load resistance that maximizes power transfer in a voltage divider circuit.  In this section, you will simulate the same circuit in KiCad and verify your results.

- Sweep the value of $R_2$ (representing the load resistance) from 0.1 to 10k$\Omega$ in increments of 100$\Omega$, for a fixed $R_1$ of 1k$\Omega$ (representing the source resistance).
- Plot the power dissipated in $R_2$ as a function of $R_2$ and identify the value that maximizes power transfer.

### Simulate the Operating Point (OP) Analysis

- Operating Point simulations are appropriate for circuits that have DC sources and single-valued element current / voltage values.
- Run an OP simulation for this circuit and verify your results, as shown annoted in the circuit above and summarized below.

### Simulate DC Sweeps

- Perform a new analysis that sweeps several components over a range of values:
    - Sweep $V_1$ from 1 to 10 V in increments of 0.2 V
    - Sweep $I_1$ from 1 to 5 A in increments of 0.2 A
- Plot:
    - $I_{R_2}$
    - $P_{V_1}$
    - $P_{I_1}$

You should see results similar to those shown below.
