Please complete the following problems and tasks, and upload your solutions to Gradescope, using the [formatting guidelines](_formatting_guidelines.qmd) below.

1. **Variable Resistor / Potentiometer** For the circuit below, determine the
power absorbed by the variable resistor ($R$), ranging from 0-20 $\Omega$.  Plot
the power absorption as a function of $R$.  Your plot should be generated
"formally" using Python (i.e., not hand-drawn).  Include your code with your
plot.  

::: callout-tip
Presenting your code with your plot may be most easily done using a Jupyter
notebook, where you can render your output as a PDF for upload to Gradescope.
This is a good opportunity to make sure you know how to do this.

1. **Internal Source Resistance** For the circuit below, solve for the following:

    a. Find the total power supplied by the ideal source.  (*Hint: that implies the value of $R_S$)

    a. Find the power dissipated and lost in the nonideal source.

    a. What is the power supplied by the source to the circuit as a function of the load resistance ($R_L$)?

    a. Plot the voltage across the load $V_L$ and the power delivered to the load ($P_L$) as a function of current $I_L: 0-30 A$.  (Like the previous problem, include code and plot.)

1. **Series Resistance**

1. **Circuit Analysis**

1. **Equivalent Resistance**

1. **Equivalent Resistance**

1. **Voltage Division**

1. **Thermistor**

1. **Material Conductance**  Copper and nickel-chromium ("nichrome") are two common conductors you will find in your living space.

    a. Where do you commonly find these two conductors in your living space, and what are the properties of these conductors that make them appropriate for their application(s)?

    a. Aluminum is another common conductor user in high voltage transmission lines and high power household appliance wires.  Why would aluminum be considered over copper for these applications?

    a. Why isn't aluminum wiring used instead of copper in wiring most building outlets and lighting circuits?
