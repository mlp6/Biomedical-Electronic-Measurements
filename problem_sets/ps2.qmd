You are asked to generate plots and include the code that you wrote to do so in
some of the problems below.  Presenting your code with your plot may be most
easily done using a Jupyter notebook, where you can render your output as a PDF
for upload to Gradescope.  This is a good opportunity to make sure you know how
to do this.

1. **Variable Resistor / Potentiometer:** For the circuit below, determine the
power absorbed by the variable resistor ($R$), ranging from 0-20 $\Omega$.  Plot
the power absorption as a function of $R$.  Your plot should be generated
"formally" using Python (i.e., not hand-drawn).  Include your code with your
plot.

1. **Internal Source Resistance:** For the circuit below, solve for the following:

    a. Find the total power supplied by the ideal source.  (*Hint: that implies the value of $R_S$)

    a. Find the power dissipated and lost in the nonideal source.

    a. What is the power supplied by the source to the circuit as a function of the load resistance ($R_L$)?

    a. Plot the voltage across the load $V_L$ and the power delivered to the load ($P_L$) as a function of current $I_L: 0-30 A$.  (Like the previous problem, include code and plot.)

1. **Series Resistance:** An incandescent lightbult rated at 100 W will dissipate
100 W as heat and light when connected to a 100 V ideal voltage source.  If 3 of
these bulbs are connected in series across this same source, determine the power
that each bulb will dissipate.

1. **Circuit Analysis**

1. **Equivalent Resistance**

1. **Equivalent Resistance**

1. **Voltage Division**

1. **Thermistor:** A thermistor is a nonlinear device that changes resistance as a function of its temperature.  The relationship between resistance and temperature is:

    $$
    R_{th}(T) = R_o e^{-\beta(T-To)}, 
    $$

    - $R_{th}$ = resistance at temperature $T$ ($\Omega$)

    - $R_o$ = resistance at $T_o$ = 298 $K$

    - $\beta$ = material constant ($K^{-1}$)

    - $T$ = absolute temperature ($K$)

    a. If $R_o = 300 \Omega$ and $\beta = 0.01 K^{-1}$, plot $R_{th}(T)$ as a function of $350 \leq T \leq 750$.

    a. If the thermistor is in parallel with a fixed value $250 \Omega$ resistor, find the expression for the equivalent resistance for this resistive network and add a new line to your plot from (a) representing the modified $R_{th}(T)$.  Be sure to plot this line in a new color and include a descriptive legend on your plot.

1. **Material Conductance**  Copper and nickel-chromium ("nichrome") are two common conductors you will find in your living space.

    a. Where do you commonly find these two conductors in your living space, and what are the properties of these conductors that make them appropriate for their application(s)?

    a. Aluminum is another common conductor user in high voltage transmission lines and high power household appliance wires.  Why would aluminum be considered over copper for these applications?

    a. Why isn't aluminum wiring used instead of copper in wiring most building outlets and lighting circuits?
