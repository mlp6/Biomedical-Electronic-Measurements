## Maximum Power Transfer

<!-- P3.73 -->
14.  If the conditions for maximum power transfer between the source and the load exist, determine the following:

a. The value of the load resistance, $R_L$.

b. The power dissipated by $R_L$.

c. The efficiency of the circuit (i.e., the ratio of the power dissipated by $R_L$ to the total power supplied by the source ($V_T$)).

<!-- P3.75 -->
15. Remember that a non-ideal voltage source can be modeled as an ideal voltage source ($V_S$)in series with a resistor ($R_S$).  For the resistive load ($R_L$) shown in the circuit below:

![](images/ps3/max_power_3_75.png)

a. Plot the power dissipated in the load as a function of $R_L$ for a reasonable range of $R_L$ values.

b. What can you conclude from you plot in part (a) regarding the value of $R_L$
that maximizes the power dissipated in the load and how that tapers off for
lower/higher load resistances?

c. Prove, mathematically, that your conclusion is valid for all values of $R_L$ and $R_S$.
