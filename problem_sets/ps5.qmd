### AC Frequency Analysis

- Use `VSIN` for the voltage source.

- Be sure to define the SPICE-specific `0` ground (reference) node, and add the $V_{out}$ net label.

- Set all of the component values as shown in the schematic.

- Run the `Simulator` to perform a `Small-signal Analysis (AC)` using the following parameters:

    - Points per decade: 100
    
    - Start frequency: 10 Hz
    
    - Stop frequency: 1 MHz

::: {.callout-note title="AC Frequency Analysis"}
Plot the magnitude and phase of the output voltage $V_{out}$.
:::

### Transient Analysis

Use the `Transient Analysis` to show the sinusoidal waveforms of both voltage
and current through time through the capacitor.

- Set the `VSIN` source to have an amplitude of 12 V and a frequency of 120 kHz.

- Run the `Simulator` to perform a `Transient Analysis` using the following parameters:

    - Start time: 0 s
    
    - Stop time: 50 $\mu$s

    - Maximum step size: 1 $\mu$s

::: {.callout-note title="Transient Analysis"}
Plot the voltage across the capacitor $V_{out}$ and the current through the capacitor $I_{C_1}$.
