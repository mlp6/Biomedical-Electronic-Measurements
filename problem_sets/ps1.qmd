Please complete the following problems and tasks, and upload your solutions to Gradescope, using the [formatting guidelines](_formatting_guidelines.qmd) below.

1. **Battery Energy Capacity**  The energy capacity of a pacemaker battery is usually specified in milliampere-hours (mA-h).  For example, a 1000 mA-h battery can supply 1 A for 1 hour, 500 mA for 2 h, etc.

    a. How many coulombs of charge can nominally be drawn from a 3000 mA-h battery?

    b. How many electrons are necessary for your answer to (a)?


1. **Battery Charging** The figure below shows a *two-rate charge cycle* for a
battery.  Find:

    a. The total charge transferred to the battery.

    b. The total energy transferred to the battery.

1. **KCL** Apply KCL to determine the unknown currents in the circuit below.  Assume
that $I_0 = -2 A$, $I_1 = -4 A$, $I_S = 8 A$, and $V_S = 12 V$.

1. **KVL** Apply KVL to find the voltages $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the circuit below:

1. **Power Sign Conventions** For the circuit below:

    a. Which components are power sources and which are power loads?

    b. Is energy conserved in this circuit?  Explain.

1. **Power & Energy** A nichrome heating element requires 23 A at 110 V.

    a.  How much power is nominally dissipated as heat from this element?

    b.  How much energy is dissipated by this heating element over a 24-h period?

    c.  If this heating element is powered by a source at a rate of 6 cents/kWh, what is the cost of the energy neede for a 24-h period?

1. **Parallel Resistance** A 24 V battery is used to power IV pumps on two surgical beds in a post-operative suite.  The beds are attached in parallel to this single battery, and each bed should nominally act as a 75 W load on the battery.  One of the beds, however, has a larger capacity IV pump installed that acts as a cummulative 100 W load for that bed.  

    a. What is the effective resistance of each bed based on its power load?

    b. What is the total equivalent resistance experience by the battery when both beds are attached to it in parallel?

1. **More Parallel Resistance** A medical student comes into the post-operative suite described above and attaches a laptop and a cellphone (in parallel) to the battery powering the two beds.  

    a. What is the equivalent resistance of the total load now attached to the battery (2 15-W, 1 75-W and 1 100-W load, in parallel)?

    b. What is the total current drawn from the battery with these 4 loads attached?

1. **Types of Battery Cells** Answer the following questions about batteries:

    a. What are the differences between rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries, 

    a. What are the different types of rechargeable batteries (e.g., lead acid,
    NiCd, NiMH, Li-ion)?

    a. What the physical limits are for the voltage that can be generated by a
    single battery cell? 

    a. What is the nominal voltage difference between an AAA, AA, C, and D cell
    alkaline batteries?

    a. How does the power capacity of a 9 V alkaline battery compare to a D cell battery?

    a. What criteria need to be taken into account when a biomedical engineer is
    choosing a battery for an implantable device?
