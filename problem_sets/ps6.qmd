Please complete the following problems and tasks, and upload your solutions to
Gradescope, using the [formatting guidelines](_formatting_guidelines.qmd) below.

## 1. Design an Amplifier

You have an input signal described by the equation:

$$
v_{in}(t) = 0.1 \sin(2000 \pi t) \text{ V}
$$

Design an operational amplifier circuit that is powered by $\pm$ 12 V that meets the following specifications:

- Gain: The output signal should have a peak voltage of 5 V.

- Phase Shift: The output signal should be inverted (180-degree phase shift).
  
a. Sketch your circuit, labeling all relevant components and their values.

a. Derive the expression for the output voltage $v_{out}(t)$.

a. Plot both the input and output signals over 5 periods of the input signal.  Be sure to label your axes, including units.

## 2. Input Impedance

a. Describe why we typically want the input impedance of an op-amp circuit to be very high.

a. What is the input impedance of your circuit from Problem 1?

a. If the input impedance of your circuit from Problem 1 isn't "ideal" given the considerations you described in part (a), suggest a modification to your circuit that would improve the input impedance.

## 3. Op-Amp Saturation

You have an input signal described by the equation:

$$
v_{in}(t) = 0.2 \cos(1000 \pi t) \text{ V}
$$

What is the maximum gain that you can achieve with a single op-amp stage powered by $\pm$ 12 V without clipping the output signal?

## 4. DC Offset

You have an input signal described by the equation:

$$
v_{in}(t) = 0.05 \sin(500 \pi t) + 0.5 \text{ V}
$$

Design an operational amplifier circuit powered by $\pm$ 12 V that creates an output signal described by the equation:

$$
v_{out}(t) = 2 \sin(500 \pi t) \text{ V}
$$

::: callout-note
Note the phase of the output signal relative to the input signal.  You can use more than one op-amp stage if necessary.
:::

a. Sketch your circuit, labeling all relevant components and their values.

a. For your design, how much power does your $v_{in}(t)$ signal source deliver if your overall circuit is driving a load of 100 k$\Omega$?

## 5. Differential Amplifier

For the differential amplifier circuit that was presented in [lecture](../slides/opamps.qmd), we make an assumption that $R_1 = R_2$ and $R_3 = R_4$.

![Differential Amplifier Circuit](images/differential_amp.png){fig-align="center"}

If $R_2 = (1\pm0.1)R_1$ and $R_4 = (1\pm0.1)R_3$, meaning that the resistors can vary by as much as 10% from their nominal values, what is the maximum possible error in the output voltage $V_{out}$ when the input voltages are $V_1 = 2$ V and $V_2 = 1$ V?  Assume that $R_1 = R_3 = 10$ k$\Omega$.
